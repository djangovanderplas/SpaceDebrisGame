WELCOME TO SPACE SWEEPER
------------------------
The game is about space debris. Although it is not exactly the topic of energy transition (it is really hard to find a space related topic to that), it does have to do with sustainability.
The story is as follows: Russia has recklessly shot down the ISS and big pieces of debris are threatening both earth and satellites in orbit. It is your task to control the the Space Sweeper to clean up this space debris. But be careful of the red satellites, you don't want to damage our military satelites! And obviously don't crash the Space Sweeper into earth...

--- CONTROL ---
You can control the game using the left and right button on your keyboard. Right fires thrust prograde and left fires retrograde. Using these two controls you can reach any orbit possible! The game simulates orbital mechanics realistically and is therefore quite hard to control.

--- OBJECTIVE ---
The goal of this game is to raise awaresness of the space debris problem and to show how hard it is to actually clean something in space. If only 5, 20 or 50 pieces are created in a collision and it is this hard to clean in this game, imagine real life in which we have hundreds if not thousands of pieces in 3d! It also aims to teach people about orbital mechanics in which simply firing towards an object sometimes only brings you away. You win the level if you have cleaned all the space debris without crashing into earth, military satelites or leave the screen to no longer return :).  

--- SIMULATION ---
The simulation uses a real size earth with real size particles for the simulation. For the drawing obviously the satellites need to be drawn bigger. The game runs at 1000x the speed of real life since a (low earth) orbit otherwise would take about 2 hours. For every simulated second a timestep if made in the game, this means for every second each object has moved a 1000 times! The particles follow the orbital equations of motion and therefore follow perfect Keplerian orbits. They also neglect drag of any upper atmosphere since this is neglegable. And obviously we are simulating in 2d.
